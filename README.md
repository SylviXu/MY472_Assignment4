# MY472_Assignment4
This is my answer to assignment 4.

This repository includes:
- some code scripts
- output figures
- raw data scraped from the web
- an R Markdown file
- the final html report
- output cache
...

Notes:
The R scripts include the initial codes for each section of this project.
Please use the file "final output.Rmd" if you want to replicate the code. 
All API keys used here are coded as credential. Please use your own keys when replicating the code.
The YouTube API has daily query limits, so it is possible to retrieve nothing when you run the code overtime.
